#### Oriention & Rules

Make sure the code and the `.md` files are matching.

1. If you're using a new function which is not listed in [`function-cheat-sheet`](https://github.com/xiaowuc2/matlab-for-machine-leaning/tree/main/MATLAB%20Onramp#function-cheat-sheet) you should add it on the list so it's get easier to revise from the list.
2. If you add a new `Matlab` course make sure you should create another folder naming the Course, along with add it in the course [`README.md`](https://github.com/xiaowuc2/matlab-for-machine-leaning#%EF%B8%8F-whats-in-the-repository) table.
3. If you find a topic intriguing mark it with `‚ö†Ô∏è`
